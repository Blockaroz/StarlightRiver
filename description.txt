Warning: Like all content mods, Starlight River is best experienced as the main focus of a modpack. Do not report balance inconsistencies or progression skips when played with other large mods.

Starlight River is a content mod with a focus on high quality and balanced content, with plans for the entirety of vanilla Terraria's progression and maybe even a bit after. We also feel that the modding space neglects aspects of the game that aren't purely related to combat (like bosses or item sets), so expect more than pure combat, with things like a modular cooking system, ritual crafting, improved fishing, advanced herbology, and even a potential source of power to drive various automation-oriented items and tiles.
